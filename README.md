# Notes

This repo contains all vim plugins that used by myself.

## How to add/delete a plugin repo

Just edit plugins-start.txt and plugins-opt.txt file to suite the needs.

And then

```bash
task sync
```

## How to update plugins

```
task update
```

## Others

Use
```
task -l
```
to see all available tasks.

But task like "add", "remove" may not useful than "sync".
